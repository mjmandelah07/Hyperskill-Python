1.What is a variable?
Variable is a named place where you can store some value and access the value later.

For example, you calculate something and would like to reuse the formula for some other numbers. In this case, you operate only these "boxes".

2.Defining a variable and assigning values
You can keep almost anything in variables just by assigning the new value for a named variable with an equal sign. Also, following PEP 8, one space before and after the assignment sign is considered good practice.

    day_of_week = "Monday"

Now you have a string type value "Monday" stored in computer memory. You can retrieve the value by calling the variable name.

            print(day_of_week)  # Monday
Now, day_of_week stores a value of the str type.

           print(type(day_of_week))  # <class 'str'>
You can always assign a new value to a defined variable:

            day_of_week = "Tuesday"
Now, you will retrieve another value:

            print(day_of_week)  # Tuesday

It is possible to assign the value of one variable to another variable:

           a = 10
           b = a  # b is 10


Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable.
            month = "December"
            print(type(month))  # <class 'str'>

Now, let's assign the number of this month to the variable and print its type again.
                 month = 12
                 print(type(month))  # <class 'int'>

This works because Python is a language with dynamic typing.


3.Naming rules
each variable has a specific name that distinguishes it from other variables. There are some rules for naming variables that you should follow:

Names are case-sensitive (month is not the same as Month);
i.A name begins with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, and underscores (e.g. user_name, score1, _count);
ii.A name cannot start with a digit (for example, 2q is not a valid name);
iii.A name must not be a keyword.
