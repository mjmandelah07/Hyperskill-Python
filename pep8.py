# PEPS
# 1.PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.
# There are different types of PEP and the most useful one for beginners is the informational PEP.
# PEPs of this kind typically describe commonly accepted guidelines or conventions about the language, so they can be very helpful.
# Besides PEP 8, which is an official style guide, another great PEP to look at is the Zen of Python.

# 2.The length of a line
# Do not use more than 79 characters in a line of code. Shorter lines look better in code editors.

# 3.Avoid extra spaces
# Sometimes you may add some spaces even if you don't really need it. This will reduce the readability of your code.

# Avoid extra spaces within parentheses.
print('Hello!')  # Good
# Bad: print('Hello!')

# Avoid an extra space before an open parenthesis.
print('some text')  # Good
# Bad: print('some text')

# 4. Quotes
# As it was already mentioned, you can use either single or double quotes to define strings.
# The only recommendation in PEP 8 is that if a string contains single or double quotes,  you should use the other one to avoid backslashes.

print("It's a good string!")  # Good

# Bad and harder to read: print('It\'s a bad string!')
